Ubuntu Docker container for Laravel web applications
====================================================

Larazest/full is an image for running [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) applications, with some extra tools:

- ruby and some gems

If you don't need the extra tools, just use [larazest/base](https://github.com/larazest/base). The base image has
